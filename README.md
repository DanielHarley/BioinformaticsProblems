# BioinformaticsProblems
Welcome to my repository of bioinformatics solutions from the website Rosalind! As a budding bioinformatician, I've been using Rosalind to practice my coding skills and learn more about this fascinating field.

Rosalind is a platform that provides a collection of bioinformatics problems, ranging from the basics of DNA and RNA manipulation to more complex topics such as genome assembly and phylogenetic trees. Each problem comes with a dataset and a specific computational task to solve using programming. By solving these problems, I am able to gain practical experience with bioinformatics techniques and algorithms.

Structure
The repository is organized into folders for each problem on Rosalind. Within each folder, you will find a Python file containing my solution to the problem, as well as any input/output files provided by Rosalind.

Acknowledgments
I would like to thank the creators of Rosalind for providing these challenging bioinformatics problems and helping me improve my coding skills.

I hope this helps you create a great README file for your project! Let me know if you have any further questions.
